# Wallpaper-Swapper
Created : August 2016

This was the first project I had made in C#. It was a simple program designed to swap the desktop wallpaper on my computer to a random choice from my library of pictures. It purposefully passed over certain wallpapers and pictures, such as personal photos or wallpapers for dual monitor setups (not working in 1.2). 

The program was executed by invoking the .exe file on login by adding a policy in gpedit.msc. I also added a contextual menu option when right clicking on the desktop by adding a registry key.

There are a couple bugs present, documented in the Issues section.
